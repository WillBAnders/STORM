<!--
Before submitting a feature request, please make sure you've done the following:

 - Check for existing feature requests - use reactions to bump open features
   instead of commenting, and comments on rejected features to be reconsidered
 - Ensure you are using the latest release (and that it does not support this)

If you are unsure whether a feature is already available or would be considered,
please ask a maintainer and we'll work with you from there.
